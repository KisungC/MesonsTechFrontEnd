[Application Link](https://dvl2wjnnoc853.cloudfront.net/)

## Getting Started

Running backend and frontend locally. (Optional)

1. Download the backend, please go to [this link](https://github.com/KisungC/CRUDSpringBootDynamoDB)

2. Run the backend application.

3. Change the fetch api command to "localhost:5000" located in /src/component/TaskItem.jsx and TaskForm.jsx

This application uses:

1. react-bootstrap

2. react-dom

3. react-router-dom

Make sure to install the package before running the application:
```bash
npm i react-bootstrap react-dom react-router-dom
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
